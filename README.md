textpattern-moderne
===================

A simple, clean, CSS-styled and modified theme that cleans up the cruft and brings TXP into the modern age.  

As TXP users know, the admin has existed in its current state since the original days when Dean Allen originally created Textpattern. While it's still pretty good, it's certainly showing some of its age.

I've grown tired, and a little weary, of the default theme and so, spent a bit of time overwriting and cleaning up the admin to bring it up to a clean, modern feel.

You can see screenshots of it here:

How to Install:
===============

1) Clone/download the files. 

2) Login to your server and navigate to where your Textpattern install resides and then:

textpattern > theme > classic

3) Save/copy/download/rename the following files for backup purposes: textpattern.css, textpattern.gif, expand_collapse.gif

4) Upload all the files included in this package. 

5) Navigate to your TXP admin on the web and refresh. Ta-da!

Notes/Caveats:
==============

1) The CSS utilizes a lot of CSS3 and modern CSS. This package is best used in a modern browser. Your mileage may vary.

2) The CSS is currently sloppy. I will update and clean up when I have more time.

3) There are some things I'd like to tweak more — positioning, a few more styles, but this is a good start.

4) Caveat emptor! But enjoy!

Please do let me know if you dig it.
